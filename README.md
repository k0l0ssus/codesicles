# This is a small code sample using Java 8's CompletableFutures to execute tasks asynchronously and concurrently. For a given String s, 

1. Check if supplied value is a valid binary (with 0s and 1s); exit if it isn't.
2. Convert the value to decimal and use the change of base log formula to determine if supplied value is a whole power of five; exit if it is
3. If not the above, look for known powers of five within the supplied string, from the largest known power of five to the least  (1).
